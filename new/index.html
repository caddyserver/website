								Additional config can be written to wire up certificate maintenance events, which can then be used to integrate with external scripts and tooling.

								Caddy 2 is a <a href="/docs/extending-caddy">highly extensible</a>, self-hosted platform on which you can build, configure, and deploy long-running services ("apps").

								<b>For example, the config shown here keeps your TLS certificates renewed for other programs to use;</b> no external tools or HTTP daemon required!

					<h2 id="gold-standard">The <span class="gold">gold standard</span> web server</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy has the most robust TLS stack on the market. With stronger memory safety guarantees than OpenSSL (Apache &amp; NGINX) and more advanced certificate automation logic than any other server or utility, Caddy keeps your sites online through problems when other servers... won't.
					</p>
					<p>
						Caddy was the first server to fully automate public certificate management&mdash;so we've been doing this longer than anyone. With more than 50 million certificates under management, Caddy has set the gold standard for other servers to live up to.

							<h3 class="green">OCSP stapling saves the day</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy automatically staples OCSP responses and caches them to weather outages. In 2018, many popular sites went down for users of mainstream browsers because crucial OCSP infrastructure had an extended outage. Only Caddy staples and caches OCSP responses by default, so all Caddy sites were unaffected.

							<h3 class="purple">On guard against revocation</h3>
							<p>
								In 2020, a mass certificate revocation event left many sysadmins scrambling to renew their certificates ahead of schedule. Caddy automatically renews certificates that get revoked, and all Caddy sites were unaffected. (This was before ARI existed.)

							<h3 class="blue">Stands tall during audits</h3>
							<p>
								Companies have deployed Caddy in front of their site just hours before important audits&mdash;potentially saving their compliance status&mdash;because of Caddy's safe defaults and "batteries included" approach.
