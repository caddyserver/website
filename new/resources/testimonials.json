		"quote": "I think we should consider making Caddy the default ACME client recommendation. … It allows for better integration between the TLS server and the ACME management of those certificates. … [ACME clients with] Apache and NGINX are inherently more error prone and brittle than having the TLS server manage its certificates itself. … Caddy is written in a memory-safe language. Adoption of memory-safe programming languages is something that both ISRG and the broader computer security community have been encouraging more and more lately.",
