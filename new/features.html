					<h2>
						Overview
					</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy is essentially a configuration management system that can run various apps like an HTTP server, TLS certificate manager, PKI facilities, and more. It can be extended with plugins known as config modules.
					</p>
					<p>
						Caddy sports a flexible and powerful HTTP reverse proxy, on-line configuration API, and a robust, production-ready static file server, and serves all sites over HTTPS by default with automagic TLS certificates.
					</p>

					<h3 class="green">Overall program technical specifications</h3>

					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Language</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								The language choice is crucial for a web server. Most servers (NGINX, Apache, HAProxy, etc.) and their dependencies are written in C, which are vulnerable to catastrophic memory safety bugs like Heartbleed. Go programs like Caddy are impervious to a whole class of security vulnerabilities.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Go
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Build artifacts</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy compiles directly to native CPU instructions. There is no interpreter required; and many instructions are architecture-optimized.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Platform-native static binary
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Runtime dependencies</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy is statically compiled. Dynamically-linked applications can easily break in production and may be less secure as shared executable resources are loaded from various places around the system. Generally, Caddy binaries do not necessarily require external libraries &mdash; not even libc.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								None
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Compile time</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								On consumer hardware, standard Caddy builds compile in just a few seconds. This is crucial for rapid iteration, plugin development, and low-cost deployments.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								5 seconds
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Deployment environments</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy can go practically anywhere and be deployed a variety of ways. In general, upgrading is as simple as replacing the binary.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Command line interface</li>
								<li>System service</li>
								<li>Containers</li>
								<li>Kubernetes</li>
								<li>Embedded</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Supply chain and releases</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Go modules verify the integrity of our dependencies and we cryptographically sign our release artifacts so you know what you can trust.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Cryptographically verified
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Operating systems</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy runs on every major platform for which Go compiles.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Linux</li>
								<li>Windows</li>
								<li>macOS</li>
								<li>FreeBSD</li>
								<li>OpenBSD</li>
								<li>NetBSD</li>
								<li>Android</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Microarchitectures</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Run Caddy with native code on numerous CPU platforms.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>x86 (i386, i686)</li>
								<li>x86-64 (AMD64)</li>
								<li>ARM</li>

								<li>RISCV64</li>
								<li>S390X</li>
								<li>Apple Silicon (Apple ARM; M1, M2, etc.)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Regular expression engine</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy's regular expression language is <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">based on the Thompson NFA and has numerous performance improvements over PCRE</a> used by other web servers. It guarantees the runtime cost increases linearly instead of exponentially. This is ideal when evaluating untrusted input.

							<div class="detail">
								RE2
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Concurrency model</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Go's runtime optimizes scheduled CPU time in smarter ways than the operating system can using lightweight user-space threads called goroutines. Caddy easily handles hundreds of thousands of requests per second.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Goroutines (epoll + kqueue)
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Plugin model</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy can be extended by compile-time plugins, which compile as native code, in a way that cannot be broken during deployments or by system upgrades. With no IPC or RPC calls, Caddy extensions perform equally well with native code.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Compile-time static

							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>RESTful HTTP API</li>
								<li>Config files</li>
								<li>Secure remote access</li>
								<!-- <li>Optimistic concurrency</li> -->
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>App modules</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Top-level configuration structures are called app modules, or Caddy apps. They provide the bulk of Caddy's functionality. Anyone can write app modules, and Caddy comes with several standard apps built-in.

						Configuration
					</h2>
					<p>
						We've designed Caddy so that its configuration not only provides access to features, but <i>it IS a feature</i> in and of itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						No more quibbling over which config file format is the best: use whatever you want! Caddy's <a href="/docs/config-adapters">config adapters</a> allow you to use whatever config format you prefer.
					</p>
					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Native config format</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy's native configuration format is ubiquitous: it has tooling in nearly every operating system, platform, programming language, and API ecosystem. Almost all other formats can be translated down into JSON, which balances human readability and programmability. You'll find it a powerful ally of your web server.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								JSON
							</div>
