					Overview
				</h2>
				<p>
					Caddy is essentially a configuration management system that can run various apps like an HTTP server, TLS certificate manager, PKI facilities, and more. It can be extended with plugins known as config modules. At the end of the page, we list capabilities that are provided by known, popular plugins.
				</p>
				<p>
					Caddy sports a powerful and flexible HTTP reverse proxy, on-line configuration API, and a robust, production-ready static file server, and serves all sites over HTTPS by default with automagic TLS certificates.
