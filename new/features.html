					<h2>
						Overview
					</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy is essentially a configuration management system that can run various apps like an HTTP server, TLS certificate manager, PKI facilities, and more. It can be extended with plugins known as config modules.
					</p>
					<p>
						Caddy sports a flexible and powerful HTTP reverse proxy, on-line configuration API, and a robust, production-ready static file server, and serves all sites over HTTPS by default with automagic TLS certificates.
					</p>

						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Language</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								The language choice is crucial for a web server. Language impacts development speed and ease, performance, testing, deployment complexity, ecosystem reliability, dependencies, tooling, error handling and reliability, and much, much more. Go offers strong advantages in all these areas, allowing for rapid development, robust production performance, and high scalability.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Go
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Memory safety guarantees</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Most servers (NGINX, Apache, HAProxy, etc.) and their dependencies are written in C, which are vulnerable to catastrophic memory safety bugs (such as buffer overflows) like Heartbleed. Go programs like Caddy are impervious to a whole class of security vulnerabilities.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Strong
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Build artifacts</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy compiles directly to native CPU instructions. There is no interpreter required; and many instructions are architecture-optimized. Static binaries are also <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Glibc-LD-Nasty-Root-Bug">more secure</a> because there is no dynamic linking.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Platform-native static binary
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Runtime dependencies</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy is statically compiled. Dynamically-linked applications can easily break in production and <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2023/10/03/cve-2023-4911/looney-tunables-local-privilege-escalation-glibc-ld-so.txt">may be less secure</a> as shared executable resources are loaded from various places around the system. Generally, Caddy binaries do not necessarily require external libraries &mdash; not even libc.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								None
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Compile time</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								On consumer hardware, standard Caddy builds compile in just a few seconds. This is crucial for rapid iteration, plugin development, and low-cost deployments.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								5 seconds
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Deployment environments</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy can go practically anywhere and be deployed a variety of ways. In general, upgrading is as simple as replacing the binary.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Command line interface</li>
								<li>System service</li>
								<li>Containers</li>
								<li>Kubernetes</li>
								<li>Embedded</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Supply chain and releases</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Go modules verify the integrity of our dependencies and we cryptographically sign our release artifacts so you know what you can trust.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Cryptographically verified
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Operating systems</h4>
							<div class="benefits">

							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Regular expression engine</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy's regular expression language is <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">based on the Thompson NFA and has numerous performance improvements over PCRE</a> used by other web servers. It guarantees the runtime cost increases linearly instead of exponentially. This is ideal when evaluating untrusted input.

						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Concurrency model</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Go's runtime optimizes scheduled CPU time in smarter ways than the operating system can using lightweight user-space threads called goroutines. Caddy utilizes all CPU cores and easily handles hundreds of thousands of requests per second.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Goroutines (epoll + kqueue)
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Plugin model</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy can be extended by compile-time plugins, which compile as native code, in a way that cannot be broken during deployments or by system upgrades. With no IPC or RPC calls, Caddy extensions perform equally well with native code.

						Configuration
					</h2>
					<p>
						We've designed Caddy so that its configuration not only provides access to features, but <i>it IS a feature</i> in and of itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						No more quibbling over which config file format is the best: use whatever you want! Caddy's <a href="/docs/config-adapters">config adapters</a> allow you to use whatever config format you prefer.
					</p>
					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Native config format</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy's native configuration format is ubiquitous: it has tooling in nearly every operating system, platform, programming language, and API ecosystem. Almost all other formats can be translated down into JSON, which balances human readability and programmability. You'll find it a powerful ally of your web server.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								JSON

					<h2>
						Automatic HTTPS
					</h2>
					<p>
						Our flagship feature, powered by <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic">CertMagic</a>. Caddy is the first and only major server that enables HTTPS by default, and automatically procures and renews certificates for all your sites.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fully-native, integrated auto-HTTPS is far superior to any solution that requires external tooling or cron jobs. Caddy's certificate maintenance is the best in the industry because it is more robust, reliable, and scalable than any other solution. Caddy simplifies your infrastructure instead of complexifying it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sure, you can try deploying 100,000 sites with Certbot and a cron job&mdash;but if that doesn't fall over by itself, the web server will. Only Caddy is designed to massively scale TLS certificates both horizontally and vertically.
					</p>
					<p>
						Never manually generate a CSR again. Never click a link in an email to download a certificate. Never (mis)configure your web server to use them. Never miss reminders to renew your certificates, one-by-one, every few months before they expire. You won't even have to think about certificates or TLS.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's truly automagic.
					</p>

					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Compliance</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy's TLS <i>defaults</i> are secure without any additional configuration, and passes compliance tests across various industries.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>PCI DSS compliant</li>
								<li>NIST compliant</li>
								<li>HIPAA compliant</li>
								<li>Industry best practices</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>On-Demand TLS</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Serving domains that aren't yours? Or have lots of them? No problem! With just a few lines of config, On-Demand TLS gets certificates dynamically during TLS handshakes, scaling your deployments to tens of thousands of certs. This functionality is exclusive to Caddy.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Certificate issuers</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Get certificates from any issuing authority in a way compatible with them. Certificate issuers take a CSR and return a certificate resource. Most sites will simply use ACME to get certificates. But Caddy can also issue its own self-signed certificates for internal use, testing, or development. Caddy's issuer sources are pluggable, so Caddy can automate certificates from any issuer modules.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>ACME</li>
								<li>Internal (self-signed)</li>
								<li class="nonstandard">Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Certificate managers</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Unlike issuers, which take a CSR and return a certificate that Caddy has to manage, certificate managers are modules that can return always-valid certificates on-demand; that is, they are managing the certificates for us. Caddy can get interface with HTTP endpoints or Tailscale to get certificates in this manner, with other ways available through plugins.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>HTTP</li>
								<li>Tailscale</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Cluster coordination</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Across all Caddy instances configured with the same storage, Caddy automatically coordinates and shares resources across the cluster. This includes certificate operations and the certificates themselves, OCSP staples, and session ticket keys. This results in reduced latency for your clients and higher scalability.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Obtaining &amp; renewing certificates</li>
								<li>Loading existing certificates</li>
								<li>OCSP staples</li>
								<li>Session ticket keys (STEKs)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Redirect HTTP to HTTPS</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								By default, HTTP requests will be redirected to HTTPS.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Automatic redirects
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>OCSP</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								OCSP indicates when certificates are revoked. Servers should staple OCSP responses to certificates to provide clients with better security and privacy. Caddy is the first and only server to do this automatically and by default. It also caches responses to weather OCSP responder outages, and shares them across its cluster. This can all be disabled if needed.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Automatic OCSP stapling with caching
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Must-Staple</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy can obtain certificates that force OCSP stapling if the CA supports it. This may grant a higher degree of security in the case of revocation.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Revocation handling</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Revoked certificates automatically get replaced. Because Caddy staples and refreshes OCSP responses, it can detect if your certificate has been revoked, and if so, it will replace i
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Session ticket hardening</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								TLS connections are pointless if an attacker steals the key to encrypt session tickets. Caddy has been <a href="https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/forward-secrecy-imc16.pdf">academically cited</a> as the only server to rotate these keys regularly to limit attack windows.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Automatic STEK rotation
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Key types</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								You can customize the type of key used for your certificates.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Ed25519</li>
								<li>ECDSA P256</li>
								<li>ECDSA P384</li>
								<li>RSA 2048</li>
								<li>RSA 4096</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Certificate lifetimes</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								<p>Most ACME clients assume 90-day certificates, or don't expect certificates shorter than 7 days. Caddy can successfully manage certificates with lifetimes on the order of hours and minutes.</p>
								<p>Instead of hard-coding a certain age before renewing, Caddy computes the age relative to the lifespan of each certificate, called a Renewal Window Ratio. By default, Caddy renews certificates after 2/3 of their usable lifetime. This ratio works for most validity periods, but can be adjusted.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Any lifetime
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Intelligent error handling</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								If Caddy can't get a certificate, errors are logged and Caddy will backoff exponentially and retry as long as needed until it succeeds (typically up to 30 days but could be longer). Caddy makes every reasonable effort to keep your certificate renewed.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Exponential backoff
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Built-in throttling</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy conforms to best practices and doesn't blast CAs with requests for certificates; instead, each order is carefully timed to avoid overwhelming CA servers.
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h3 class="purple">ACME</h3>

					<p>
						Caddy's ACME client is best-in-class, with higher reliability and more production experience than any other integrated ACME client available today. Caddy has been using ACME since before the public availability of Let's Encrypt, and Caddy works with any ACME-compatible CA.
					</p>

					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Compatibility</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Some ACME clients are only tested with Let's Encrypt. Caddy is guaranteed compatible with all ACME-capable CAs.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								All RFC 8555-compliant certificate authorities, such as:
								<ul>
									<li>Let's Encrypt</li>
									<li>ZeroSSL</li>
									<li>Google Trust Services</li>
									<li>BuyPass</li>
									<li>DigiCert</li>
									<li>GlobalSign</li>
									<li>SSL.com</li>
									<li>Smallstep</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Test endpoints</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								By default, Caddy will fall back to a CA's test or staging endpoint (if there is one) after a failed attempt at getting a certificate to avoid hitting CA-enforced production rate limits. This could also be an ACME server you set up solely for the purpose of validating DNS configurations.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Let's Encrypt (others configurable)
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>External account binding</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Optionally configure External Account Binding (EAB) to enable Caddy to work with CAs that require you to have a separate account with them.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Challenge types</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy supports all major ACME challenge types for Web PKI and can also be extended to support others.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>HTTP-01</li>
								<li>TLS-ALPN-01</li>
								<li>DNS-01</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Alternate challenge ports</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								While certain ACME challenges must use the standardized ports 80 and 443, Caddy supports listening for these on alternate ports if you are forwarding them through a router.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>HTTP (default 80)</li>
								<li>TLS-ALPN (default 443)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Smart challenge selection</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy learns what challenge types are most likely to succeed and tries those first. For example, if port 80 is blocked, it will learn to prefer the TLS-ALPN challenge which does not use port 80.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>DNS challenge integrations</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								The DNS challenge is the only one that does not require the CA being able to access your server. Solve the DNS challenge with integrations for dozens of DNS providers via <a href="https://github.com/libdns">libdns</a>. <b>This list is incomplete;</b> <a href="https://github.com/caddy-dns">see the full list of DNS providers</a>.

					<h3 class="blue">HTTP handlers</h3>

					<p>
						Handlers are modules that can be composed together to handle incoming requests precisely the way you want. Handler modules are, like the rest of Caddy, extensible and pluggable. It is not really feasible for us to list all the handlers here.
					</p>
					<p>
						In practice, handlers are paired with matchers which filter or classify requests based on various properties such as their path, headers, query string, method, and more. This allows you to selectively apply any and all of these handlers to certain requests.

					<h2>
						Reverse proxy
					</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy has the most flexible general-purpose reverse proxy in the world, featuring advanced request and response handling, dynamic routing, health checking, load balancing, circuit breaking, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						What makes Caddy's proxy unique is its design. Only the client-facing side of the proxy needs to be HTTP; the transport underlying the roundtrip with the backend can be fulfilled with any protocol!
					</p>
					<p>
						Moreover, our proxy can be programmed with highly dynamic upstreams. That is, the available upstreams can change during in-flight requests! If no backends are available, Caddy can hold onto the request until one is.
					</p>

					<h3 class="blue">High-level proxy features</h3>

					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Transports</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Transports are how Caddy gets the response from the backend. Caddy's proxy can be a front for protocols other than HTTP by using alternate transport modules. This allows Caddy to generate HTTP responses from backends that don't even speak HTTP!
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>HTTP</li>
								<li>FastCGI</li>
								<li class="nonstandard">NTLM</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Load balancing</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Selecting upstreams is a crucial function of any modern reverse proxy. Caddy has a variety of built-in load balancing policies to choose from to suit any production services. Some policies are extremely fast and lightweight; others provide upstream affinity based on properties of the client or request; others strive for even distribution by counting connections or using randomness and weights.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Random</li>
								<li>Random Choose-N</li>
								<li>Least connections</li>
								<li>Round robin</li>
								<li>Weighted round robin</li>
								<li>First available</li>
								<li>Remote IP hash</li>
								<li>Client IP hash</li>
								<li>URI hash</li>
								<li>Query hash</li>
								<li>Header hash</li>
								<li>Cookie hash</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Circuit breaking</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								A circuit breaker module can temporarily mark a backend as down before it actually goes down, to keep it up.
							</div>
							<div class="detail nonstandard">
								Latency-based
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Health checking</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Health checks detect when upstreams are unavailable. Passive health checks infer status from actual requests. Active health checks work in the background, out-of-band of client requests.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Active</li>
								<li>Passive</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Observability</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								The admin API exposes an endpoint to retrieve the traffic count and health status of the proxy upstreams.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Upstream sources</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy can get the list of upstreams in various ways. The most common is to write them into the configuration (static). Other ways are dynamic, by which a list of upstreams are returned for each request (these utilize configurable caching to enhance performance). 
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Static</li>
								<li>Dynamic: A records</li>
								<li>Dynamic: SRV records</li>
								<li>Dynamic: Multiple sources combined</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Retries</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Requests can be retried until a backend is available to successfully handle the request. During this time, the list of upstreams may even be updated while the request is still pending!
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Streaming</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Responses can be streamed directly to the client, or for better wire performance, buffered slightly and flushed periodically.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Trusted proxies</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								In order to use proxy-related headers like X-Forwarded-For, you can specify a list of IP ranges of proxies you trust. By default Caddy doesn't trust the clients.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Header manipulation</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Headers can be modified in the request going up to the backend and the response coming back down from the backend. This is similar to the general HTTP server's header handler, but this is applied while proxying.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Add</li>
								<li>Set (overwrite)</li>
								<li>Delete</li>
								<li>Substring replace</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Buffering</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								The proxy can optionally read the entire body before flushing it. This uses more memory but can be required by some backend applications or clients in some cases.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Requests</li>
								<li>Responses</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Request rewriting</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Rewriting is a different concern from proxying and is normally handled separately, but sometimes you need to rewrite requests using information from the proxy like the chosen upstream. Caddy's proxy lets you do this.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Response interception</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								By default, Caddy's proxy simply writes responses to the client. However, you can intercept the upstream's response and handle it in other ways. This includes matching only certain responses and invoking a custom handler chain you specify.
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h3 class="green">Active health checks</h3>
					<p>
						Active health checks assume a backend is down by default until that is confirmed otherwise by a health check.
					</p>

					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>HTTP request parameters</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Active health checks are performed against an HTTP endpoint on the upstream. You can customize the parameters for these HTTP requests to work for you.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Path &amp; query string</li>
								<li>Port</li>
								<li>Headers</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Timing</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								You can customize the interval at which active health checks are performed.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Success criteria</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Each active health check can be customized with a set of criteria to determine healthy or unhealthy status.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Response timeout</li>
								<li>HTTP status code</li>
								<li>Regular expression match on body</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Failure safety</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Backends that are experiencing bugs and difficulties may sometimes respond with unexpectedly large response bodies. Caddy lets you limit this to preserve proxy resources.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Limit response size
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h3 class="purple">Passive health checks</h3>
					<p>
						Passive health checks assume a backend is up by default until failure criteria are met in the course of proxying requests.
					</p>

					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Failure criteria</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								All passive health checks count connection failures. In addition, you can set more criteria needed to deem a backend as healthy during a request.

							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Concurrent request limit exceeded</li>
								<li>HTTP Status</li>
								<li>Latency</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Failure memory</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								You can customize how long to remember failures and how many failures need to be in memory to consider a backend to be down.
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>


					<h3 class="blue">HTTP transport</h3>
					<p>
						This is the default transport module. It crafts a proxied HTTP request to obtain an HTTP response from the backend.

						Static file server
					</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy's file server is the premier way of serving static files for your website. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It's simple: specify a root directory from which to serve the files, then each request path is automatically appended to the root to get the full path of the file to serve.
					</p>
					<div class="feature-list">
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Kernel acceleration</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Caddy bypasses user-space buffers whenever possible to speed up file downloads by a significant factor.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								sendfile
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Virtual file systems</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								By default, Caddy serves files from a directory you specify on the local disk, but this file access is pluggable and can be replaced by any virtualized file system modules. This allows you to serve static files from any file store such as databases, cloud storage, or even assets embedded directly in the web server binary!
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Local disk</li>
								<li class="nonstandard">Embedded assets</li>
								<li class="nonstandard">Amazon AWS S3</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Precompressed files</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								If your deployment pipeline compresses site resources, Caddy can automatically detect them and serve them in their "precompressed" encoding for higher efficiency and greater throughput.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Gzip</li>
								<li>Brotli</li>
								<li>Zstandard</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Hide files and folders</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Increase your security posture by proactively hiding potentially-sensitive files and folders that do or could exist in your site root. You can specify individual file/folder paths, filenames regardless of their path, or glob matches to hide files/folders with a particular pattern.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								Exact paths, filenames, globular matching
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Index filenames</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Index files are files that are served if a directory is requested by the client. The filenames of index files to look for are customizable. Directory browsing can optionally be enabled if an index file is not found in a requested directory.
							</div>
							<div class="detail">
								index.html, index.txt (customizable)
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Conditional requests</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Etag, Last-Modified, and related headers are supported.
							</div>
							<ul class="detail">
								<li>Etag</li>
								<li>Last-Modified</li>
								<li>If-Match</li>
								<li>If-None-Match</li>
								<li>If-Modified-Since</li>
								<li>If-Unmodified-Since</li>
								<li>If-Range</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Range requests</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Common for streaming large files and resuming downloads, clients requesting certain ranges of files will not be disappointed or surprised. Caddy properly handles HTTP requests with Range headers.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Canonical paths</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								In general, there are multiple URIs for a single file or directory. For example: /, /index.html, and /index.html/ represent the same resource. Caddy uses HTTP redirects to enforce path canonicalization (removing trailing slashes from files, and adding them for directories).
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-row">
							<h4>Pass-thru mode</h4>
							<div class="benefits">
								Sometimes you only want to serve a file if it exists, otherwise continue with the next handler in the chain, rather than returning an error to the client.
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

							<h3 class="blue">File browser</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy's file server comes alive through its modern file browser that looks attractive on mobile and desktop. It has more features and utility than any other standard HTTP file server!
