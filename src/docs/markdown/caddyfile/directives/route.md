title: route (Caddyfile directive)
---

# route

Evaluates a group of directives literally and as a single unit.

Directives contained in a route block will not be reordered internally. Only HTTP handler directives (directives which add handlers or middleware to the chain) can be used in a route block.

This directive is a special case in that its subdirectives are also regular directives.


## Syntax

```caddy-d
route [<matcher>] {
	<directives...>
}
```

- **<directives...>** is a list of directives or directive blocks, one per line, just like outside of a route block; except these directives will not be reordered. Only HTTP handler directives can be used.



## Utility

The `route` directive is helpful in certain advanced use cases or edge cases to take absolute control over parts of the HTTP handler chain.

Because the order of HTTP middleware evaluation is significant, the Caddyfile will normally reorder directives after parsing to make the Caddyfile easier to use; you don't have to worry about what order you type things.

While the built-in order is compatible with most sites, sometimes you need to take manual control over the order, either for the whole site or just a part of it. That's what the `route` directive is for.

To illustrate, consider the case of two terminating handlers: `redir` and `file_server`. Both write the response to the client and do not call the next handler in the chain, so only one of these will be executed for a certain request. Which comes first? Normally, `redir` is executed before `file_server` because usually you would want to issue a redirect only in specific cases and serve files in the general case.

However, there may be occasions where the second directive (`redir`) has a more specific matcher than the second (`file_server`). In other words, you want to redirect in the general case, and serve only a specific file.

So you might try a Caddyfile like this (but this will not work as expected!):

```caddy
example.com

file_server /specific.html
redir https://anothersite.com{uri}
```

The problem is that, internally, `redir` comes before `file_server`, but in this case the matcher for `redir` is a superset of the matcher for `file_server` (`*` is a superset of `/specific.html`).

Fortunately, the solution is easy: just wrap those two directives in a `route` block:

```caddy
example.com

route {
	file_server /specific.html
	redir https://anothersite.com{uri}
}
```

<aside class="tip">
	Another way to do this is to make the two matchers mutually exclusive, but this can quickly become complex if there are more than one or two conditions. With the <code>route</code> directive, the mutual exclusivity of the two handlers is implicit because they are both terminal handlers.
</aside>

And now `file_server` will be chained in before `redir` because the order is taken literally.


## Examples

Strip `/api` prefix from request path just before proxying all API requests to a backend:

```caddy-d
route /api/* {
	uri strip_prefix /api
	reverse_proxy localhost:9000
}
```
