# Global options

The Caddyfile has a way for you to specify options that apply globally. Some options act as default values; others customize HTTP servers and don't apply to just one particular site; while yet others customize the behavior of the Caddyfile [adapter](/docs/config-adapters).

The very top of your Caddyfile can be a **global options block**. This is a block that has no keys:

```caddy
{
	...
}
```

There can only be one at most, and it must be the first block of the Caddyfile.

Possible options are:

```caddy
{
	# General Options

## General Options

##### `debug`
Enables debug mode, which sets the log level to `DEBUG` for the [default logger](#log). This reveals more details that can be useful when troubleshooting (and is very verbose in production). We ask that you enable this before asking for help on the [community forums](https://caddy.community). For example, at the top of your Caddyfile, if you have no other global options:

```caddy
{
	debug
}
```


##### `http_port`
The port for the server to use for HTTP. For internal use only; does not change the HTTP port for clients. Default: `80`


##### `https_port`
The port for the server to use for HTTPS. For internal use only; does not change the HTTPS port for clients. Default: `443`


##### `default_bind`
The default bind address(es) to be used for all sites, if the [`bind` directive](/docs/caddyfile/directives/bind) is not used in the site. Default: empty, which binds to all interfaces.

<aside class="tip">

Keep in mind that this will only apply to servers which are generated by the Caddyfile; this means that the HTTP server created by [Automatic HTTPS](/docs/automatic-https) for HTTP->HTTPS redirects will not inherit these bind addresses. To work around this, make sure to declare an `http://` site (it can be empty, with no directives) so that it exists when the Caddyfile is adapted, to receive the bind addresses.

</aside>



##### `order`
Assigns an order to HTTP handler directive(s). As HTTP handlers execute in a sequential chain, it is necessary for the handlers to be executed in the right order. Standard directives have [a pre-defined order](/docs/caddyfile/directives#directive-order), but if using third-party HTTP handler modules, you'll need to define the order explicitly by either using this option or placing the directive in a [`route` block](/docs/caddyfile/directives/route). Ordering can be described absolutely (`first` or `last`), or relatively (`before` or `after`) to another directive.

For example, to use the [`replace-response` plugin](https://github.com/caddyserver/replace-response), you'd want to make sure its directive is ordered after `encode` so that it can perform replacements before the response is encoded (because responses flow up the handler chain, not down):

```caddy-d
order replace after encode
```


##### `storage`
Configures Caddy's storage mechanism. The default is [`file_system`](/docs/json/storage/file_system/). There are many other available [storage modules](/docs/json/storage/) provided as plugins.

For example, to change the file system's storage location:

```caddy-d
storage file_system /path/to/custom/location
```

Customizing the storage module is typically needed when syncing Caddy's storage across multiple instances of Caddy to make sure they all use the same certificates and keys. See the [Automatic HTTPS section on storage](/docs/automatic-https#storage) for more details.


##### `storage_clean_interval`
How often to scan storage units for old or expired assets and remove them. These scans exert lots of reads (and list operations) on the storage module, so choose a longer interval for large deployments. The value is a [duration value](/docs/conventions#durations). Default: `24h`.

Storage will always be cleaned when the process first starts. Then, a new cleaning will be started this duration after the previous cleaning started if the previous cleaning finished in less than half the time of this interval (otherwise next start will be skipped).


##### `renew_interval`
How often to scan all loaded, managed certificates for expiration, and trigger renewal if expired. Default: `10m`.


##### `ocsp_interval`
How often to check if OCSP staples need updating. Default: `1h`.


##### `admin`
Customizes the [admin API endpoint](/docs/api). Accepts placeholders. If `off`, then the admin endpoint will be disabled. If disabled, config changes will be impossible without stopping and starting the server. Remember to use the `--address` CLI flag to specify the current admin endpoint when changing this value if the currently-running admin endpoint is not at the default address.

- **origins** configures the list of remotes/origins that are allowed to connect to the endpoint.

- **enforce_origin** enables enforcement of the Origin header. (This is different from enforcing origins generally, which is always done.)


##### `persist_config`

Controls whether the current JSON config should be persisted to the [configuration directory](/docs/conventions#configuration-directory), to avoid losing config changes performed via the admin API. Currently, only the `off` option is supported. By default, the config is persisted.



##### `log`
Configures named loggers. The name can be passed to indicate a specific logger for which to customize the behavior. If no name is specified, the behavior of the `default` logger is modified. Multiple loggers with different names can be configured by using the `log` multiple times. You can read more about the `default` logger and an explanation of [how logging works in Caddy](/docs/logging).

The differs from the [`log` directive](/docs/caddyfile/directives/log), which only configures HTTP request logging (also known as access logs). The `log` global option shares its configuration structure with the directive (except for `include` and `exclude`), and complete documentation can be found on the directive's page.

- **output** configures where to write the logs. See the [`log` directive](/docs/caddyfile/directives/log#output-modules) for complete documentation.
- **format** describes how to encode, or format, the logs. See the [`log` directive](/docs/caddyfile/directives/log#format-modules) for complete documentation.
- **level** is the minimum entry level to log. Default: `INFO`.
- **include** specifies the log names to be included in this logger. For example, to include only logs emitted by the admin API, you would include `admin.api`. By default, this list is empty (i.e. all logs are included).
- **exclude** specifies the log names to be excluded from this logger. For example, to exclude only HTTP access logs, you would exclude `http.log.access`. By default, this list is empty (i.e. no logs are excluded).

The logger names that `include` and `exclude` accept depend on the modules used, and easiest way to discover them is from prior logs.

Here is an example logging as json all http access logs and admin logs to stdout:

```caddy
log default {
	output stdout
	format json
	include http.log.access admin.api
}
```

##### `grace_period`
Defines the grace period for shutting down HTTP servers (i.e. during config changes or when Caddy is stopping). During the grace period, no new connections are accepted, idle connections are closed, and active connections are impatiently waited upon to finish their requests. If clients do not finish their requests within the grace period, the server will be forcefully terminated to allow the reload to complete and free up resources. Accepts [duration values](/docs/conventions#durations). By default, the grace period is eternal, which means connections are never forcefully closed.


##### `shutdown_delay`
Defines a duration before the grace period during which a server that is going to be stopped continues to operate normally, except the `{http.shutting_down}` placeholder evaluates to `true` and `{http.time_until_shutdown}` gives the time until the grace period begins. This causes a delay if any server is being shut down as part of a config change and effectively schedules the change for a later time. It is useful for announcing to health checkers of this server's impending doom and to give time for a load balancer to move it out of the rotation; for example:

```caddy-d
handle /health-check {
	@goingDown vars {http.shutting_down} true
	respond @goingDown "Bye-bye in {http.time_until_shutdown}" 503
	respond 200
}
```


## TLS Options

##### `auto_https`
Configure automatic HTTPS. There are a few modes to choose from:

- `off`: Disabled entirely. No certificate management or redirects.
- `disable_redirects`: Disable only HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
- `disable_certs`: Disable only certificate automation.
- `ignore_loaded_certs`: Automate certificates even for names which appear on manually-loaded certificates

See the [Automatic HTTPS](/docs/automatic-https) page for more details.


##### `email`
Your email address. Mainly used when creating an ACME account with your CA, and is highly recommended in case there are problems with your certificates.


##### `default_sni`
Sets a default TLS ServerName for when clients do not use SNI in their ClientHello.


##### `fallback_sni`
If configured, the fallback becomes the TLS ServerName in the ClientHello if the original ServerName doesn't match any certificates in the cache. The uses for this are very niche; typically if a client is a CDN and passes through the ServerName of the downstream handshake but can accept a certificate with the origin's hostname instead, then you would set this as your origin's hostname. Note that Caddy must be managing a certificate for this name. <i>⚠️ Experimental</i>


##### `local_certs`
Causes all certificates to be issued internally by default, rather than through a (public) ACME CA such as Let's Encrypt. This is useful in development environments.


##### `skip_install_trust`
Skips the attempts to install the local CA's root into the system trust store, as well as into Java and Mozilla Firefox trust stores.


##### `acme_ca`
Specifies the URL to the ACME CA's directory. It is strongly recommended to set this to Let's Encrypt's [staging endpoint](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/) for testing or development. Default: ZeroSSL and Let's Encrypt's production endpoints.

Note that a globally-configured ACME CA may not apply to all sites; see the [hostname requirements](/docs/automatic-https#hostname-requirements) for using the default ACME issuer(s).

##### `acme_ca_root`
Specifies a PEM file that contains a trusted root certificate for ACME CA endpoints, if not in the system trust store.


##### `acme_eab`
Specifies an External Account Binding to use for all ACME transactions.


##### `acme_dns`
Configures the ACME DNS challenge provider to use for all ACME transactions. The tokens following the name of the provider set up the provider the same as if specified in the [`tls` directive's `acme` issuer](/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#acme).


##### `on_demand_tls`
Configures [On-Demand TLS](/docs/automatic-https#on-demand-tls) where it is enabled, but does not enable it (to enable it, use the [on_demand `tls` subdirective](/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#syntax)). Highly recommended if using in production environments, to prevent abuse.

- **ask** will cause Caddy to make an HTTP request to the given URL with a query string of `?domain=` containing the value of the domain name. If the endpoint returns a `2xx` status code, Caddy will be authorized to obtain a certificate for that name. Any other status code will result in cancelling issuance of the certificate.

- **interval** and **burst** allows `<n>` certificate operations within `<duration>` interval.


##### `key_type`
Specifies the type of key to generate for TLS certificates; only change this if you have a specific need to customize it. The possible values are: `ed25519`, `p256`, `p384`, `rsa2048`, `rsa4096`.


##### `cert_issuer`
Defines the issuer (or source) of TLS certificates. The tokens following the name of the issuer set up the issuer the same as if specified in the [`tls` directive](/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#issuer). May be repeated if you wish to configure more than one issuer to try. They will be tried in the order they are defined.


##### `ocsp_stapling`
Can be set to `off` to disable OCSP stapling. Useful in environments where responders are not reachable due to firewalls.


##### `preferred_chains`
If your CA provides multiple certificate chains, you can use this option to specify which chain Caddy should prefer. Set one of the following options:

- **smallest** will tell Caddy to prefer chains with the fewest amount of bytes.
- **root_common_name** is a list of one or more common names; Caddy will choose the first chain that has a root that matches with at least one of the specified common names.
- **any_common_name** is a list of one or more common names; Caddy will choose the first chain that has an issuer that matches with at least one of the specified common names.

Note that specifying `preferred_chains` as a global option will affect all issuers if there isn't any [overriding issuer level config](/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#acme).



## Server Options

Customizes [HTTP servers](/docs/json/apps/http/servers/) with settings that potentially span multiple sites and thus can't be rightly configured in site blocks. These options affect the listener/socket or other facilities beneath the HTTP layer.

Can be specified more than once with different `listener_address` values to configure different options per server. For example, `servers :443` will only apply to the server that is bound to the listener address `:443`. Omitting the listener address will apply the options to any remaining server.

<aside class="tip">

Use the [`caddy adapt`](/docs/command-line#caddy-adapt) command to find the listen address for the servers in your Caddyfile.

</aside>


For example, to configure different options for the servers on ports `:80` and `:443`, you would specify two `servers` blocks:

```caddy
{
	servers :443 {
		listener_wrappers {
			http_redirect
			tls
		}
	}

	servers :80 {
		protocols h1 h2c
	}
}
```


<aside class="tip">

If you are using the [`bind` directive](/docs/caddyfile/directives/bind) or the [`default_bind` global option](/docs/caddyfile/options#default_bind), the `listener_address` *MUST* match the bind address combined with the port of the site block, otherwise the settings won't be applied. For example:

```caddy
{
	# This will NOT match the server, bind address missing
	servers :8080 {
		name private
	}
	
	# This will work because it's an exact match
	servers 192.168.1.2:8080 { 
		name public
	}
}

:8080 {
	bind 127.0.0.1
}

:8080 {
	bind 192.168.1.2
}
```

</aside>



##### `name`

A custom name to assign to this server. Usually helpful to identify a server by its name in logs and metrics. If not set, Caddy will define it dynamically using a `srvX` pattern, where `X` starts with 0 and increments based on the number of servers in the config.

<aside class="tip">

Keep in mind there's a caveat if you want to name your HTTP server and are using Auto-HTTPS. The server name config doesn't persist past adapting the config, and Auto-HTTPS happens at runtime, from the JSON config. 
To overcome this, you'll need to create an empty `:80` or `http://` site block and set this option. With that Auto-HTTPS will add its redirect routes to that server. For example:

```caddy
{
	servers :443 {
		name https
	}
	
	servers :80 {
		name http
	}
}

example.com {
}

http:// {
}
```

</aside>



##### `listener_wrappers`

Allows configuring [listener wrappers](/docs/json/apps/http/servers/listener_wrappers/), which can modify the behaviour of the socket listener. They are applied in the given order.

There is a special no-op [`tls`](/docs/json/apps/http/servers/listener_wrappers/tls/) listener wrapper provided as a standard module which marks where TLS should be handled in the chain of listener wrappers. It should only be used if another listener wrapper must be placed in front of the TLS handshake.

The standard distribution of Caddy includes the [`http_redirect`](/docs/json/apps/http/servers/listener_wrappers/http_redirect/) listener wrapper, which can look at the first few bytes of an incoming request to determine if it's likely HTTP (instead of TLS), and trigger an HTTP->HTTPS redirect on the same port but using the `https://` scheme. It must be placed _before_ the `tls` listener wrapper. For example:

```caddy-d
listener_wrappers {
	http_redirect
	tls
}
```

Also included is the [`proxy_protocol`](/docs/json/apps/http/servers/listener_wrappers/proxy_protocol/) listener wrapper (prior to v2.7.0 it was only available via a plugin), which enables [PROXY protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) parsing (popularized by HAProxy). This must be used _before_ the `tls` listener wrapper since it parses plaintext data at the start of the connection:

```caddy-d
listener_wrappers {
	proxy_protocol {
		timeout 2s
		allow 192.168.86.1/24 192.168.86.1/24
	}
	tls
}
```


##### `timeouts`

- **read_body** is a [duration value](/docs/conventions#durations) that sets how long to allow a read from a client's upload. Setting this to a short, non-zero value can mitigate slowloris attacks, but may also affect legitimately slow clients. Defaults to no timeout.

- **read_header** is a [duration value](/docs/conventions#durations) that sets how long to allow a read from a client's request headers. Defaults to no timeout.

- **write** is a [duration value](/docs/conventions#durations) that sets how long to allow a write to a client. Note that setting this to a small value when serving large files may negatively affect legitimately slow clients. Defaults to no timeout.

- **idle** is a [duration value](/docs/conventions#durations) that sets the maximum time to wait for the next request when keep-alives are enabled. Defaults to 5 minutes to help avoid resource exhaustion.



##### `trusted_proxies`

Allows configuring IP ranges (CIDRs) of proxy servers from which requests should be trusted. By default, no proxies are trusted.

Enabling this causes trusted requests to have the _real_ client IP parsed from HTTP headers (by default, `X-Forwarded-For`; see [`client_ip_headers`](#client-ip-headers) to configure other headers). If trusted, the client IP is added to [access logs](/docs/caddyfile/directives/log), is available as a `{client_ip}` [placeholder](/docs/caddyfile/concepts#placeholders), and allows the use of the [`client_ip` matcher](/docs/caddyfile/matchers#client-ip). If the request is not from a trusted proxy, then the client IP is set to the remote IP address of the direct incoming connection.

Some matchers or handlers may use the trust status of the request to make additional decisions. For example, if trusted, the [`reverse_proxy`](/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy#defaults) handler will proxy and augment the sensitive `X-Forwarded-*` request headers.

Currently, only the `static` [IP source module](/docs/json/apps/http/servers/trusted_proxies/) is included with the standard distribution of Caddy, but this can be [extended](/docs/extending-caddy) with plugins to maintain a dynamic list of IP ranges.


###### `static`

Takes a static (unchanging) list of IP ranges (CIDRs) to trust.

As a shortcut, `private_ranges` can be used to match all private IPv4 and IPv6 ranges. It's the same as specifying all of these ranges: `192.168.0.0/16 172.16.0.0/12 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.1/8 fd00::/8 ::1`

```caddy-d
trusted_proxies static [private_ranges] <ranges...>
```

Here's a complete example, trusting an example IPv4 range and an IPv6 range:

```caddy
{
	servers {
		trusted_proxies static 12.34.56.0/24 1200:ab00::/32
	}
}
```


##### `client_ip_headers`

Pairing with [`trusted_proxies`](#trusted-proxies), allows configuring which headers to use to determine the client's IP address. By default, only `X-Forwarded-For` is considered. Multiple header fields can be specified, in which case the first non-empty header value is used.



##### `metrics`

Enables Prometheus metrics collection; necessary before scraping metrics. Note that metrics reduce performance on really busy servers. (Our community is working on improving this. Please get involved!)


##### `max_header_size`

The maximum size to parse from a client's HTTP request headers. It accepts all formats supported by [go-humanize](https://github.com/dustin/go-humanize/blob/master/bytes.go).


##### `log_credentials`

Since Caddy v2.5, by default, headers with potentially sensitive information (`Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Authorization` and `Proxy-Authorization`) will be logged with empty values in access logs (see the [`log` directive](/docs/caddyfile/directives/log)).

If you wish to _not_ have these headers redacted, you may enable the `log_credentials` option.


##### `protocols`

The space-separated list of HTTP protocols to support. Default: `h1 h2 h3`. Accepted values are:

- `h1` for HTTP/1.1
- `h2` For HTTP/2
- `h2c` for HTTP/2 over cleartext
- `h3` for HTTP/3

Currently, enabling HTTP/2 (including H2C) necessarily implies enabling HTTP/1.1 because the Go standard library does not let us disable HTTP/1.1 when using its HTTP server. However, either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/3 can be enabled independently.

Note that H2C ("Cleartext HTTP/2" or "H2 over TCP") and HTTP/3 are not implemented by the Go standard library, so some functionality or features may be limited. We recommend against enabling H2C unless it is absolutely necessary for your application.


##### `strict_sni_host`

Enabling this requires that a request's `Host` header matches the value of the `ServerName` sent by the client's TLS ClientHello, a necessary safeguard when using TLS client authentication. If there's a mismatch, HTTP status `421 Misdirected Request` response is written to the client.

This option will automatically be turned on if [client authentication](/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#client_auth) is configured. This disallows TLS client auth bypass (domain fronting) which could otherwise be exploited by sending an unprotected SNI value during a TLS handshake, then putting a protected domain in the Host header after establishing connection. This behavior is a safe default, but you may explicitly turn it off with `insecure_off`; for example in the case of running a proxy where domain fronting is desired and access is not restricted based on hostname.




## PKI Options

The PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) app is the foundation for Caddy's [Local HTTPS](/docs/automatic-https#local-https) and [ACME server](/docs/caddyfile/directives/acme_server) features. The app defines certificate authorities (CAs) which are capable of signing certificates.

The default CA ID is `local`. If the ID is omitted when configuring the `ca`, then `local` is assumed.

##### `name`
The user-facing name of the certificate authority. Default: `Caddy Local Authority`

##### `root_cn`
The name to put in the CommonName field of the root certificate. Default: `{pki.ca.name} - {time.now.year} ECC Root`

##### `intermediate_cn`
The name to put in the CommonName field of the intermediate certificates. Default: `{pki.ca.name} - ECC Intermediate`

##### `intermediate_lifetime`
The [duration](/docs/conventions#durations) for which intermediate certificates are valid. This value must be less than the lifetime of the root cert (`3600d`). Default: `7d`. It is recommended not to change this unless absolutely necessary.

##### `root`
A key pair (certificate and private key) to use as the root for the CA. If not specified, one will be generated and managed automatically.

- **format** is the format in which the certificate and private key are provided. Currently, only `pem_file` is supported, which is the default, so this field is optional.
- **cert** is the certificate. This should be the path to a PEM file, when using `pem_file` format.
- **key** is the private key. This should be the path to a PEM file, when using `pem_file` format.

##### `intermediate`
A key pair (certificate and private key) to use as the intermediate for the CA. If not specified, one will be generated and managed automatically.

- **format** is the format in which the certificate and private key are provided. Currently, only `pem_file` is supported, which is the default, so this field is optional.
- **cert** is the certificate. This should be the path to a PEM file, when using `pem_file` format.
- **key** is the private key. This should be the path to a PEM file, when using `pem_file` format.


## Event Options

Caddy modules emit events when interesting things happen (or are about to happen).

##### `on`
Binds an event handler to the named event. Specify the name of the event handler module, followed by its configuration.

For example, to run a command after a certificate is obtained ([third-party plugin <img src="/resources/images/external-link.svg" class="external-link">](https://github.com/mholt/caddy-events-exec) required):

```caddy-d
on cert_obtained exec systemctl reload mydaemon
```
