# Build from source

There are multiple options for building Caddy, if you need a customized build (e.g. with plugins):
- [Git](#git): Build from Git repo
- [`xcaddy`](#xcaddy): Build using `xcaddy`
- [Docker](#docker): Build a custom Docker image

Requirements:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.20 or newer

The [Package Support Files](#package-support-files-for-custom-builds-for-debianubunturaspbian) section contains instructions for users who installed Caddy using the APT command on Debian-derivative system yet need the custom build executable for their operations.



## Git

Requirements:

- Go installed (see above)

Clone the repository:

<pre><code class="cmd bash">git clone "https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy.git"</code></pre>

If you don't have git, you can download the source code as a file archive [from GitHub](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy). Each [release](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases) also has source snapshots.

Build:

<pre><code class="cmd"><span class="bash">cd caddy/cmd/caddy/</span>
<span class="bash">go build</span></code></pre>


<aside class="tip">

Due to [a bug in Go](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29228), these basic steps do not embed version information. If you want the version (`caddy version`), you need to compile Caddy as a dependency rather than as the main module. Instructions for this are in Caddy's [main.go](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/master/cmd/caddy/main.go) file. Or, you can use [`xcaddy`](#xcaddy) which automates this.

</aside>

Go programs are easy to compile for other platforms. Just set the `GOOS`, `GOARCH`, and/or `GOARM` environment variables that are different. ([See the go documentation for details.](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment))

For example, to compile Caddy for Windows when you're not on Windows:

<pre><code class="cmd bash">GOOS=windows go build</code></pre>

Or similarly for Linux ARMv6 when you're not on Linux or on ARMv6:

<pre><code class="cmd bash">GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build</code></pre>



## xcaddy

The [`xcaddy` command](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy) is the easiest way to build Caddy with version information and/or plugins.

Requirements:

- Go installed (see above)
- Make sure [`xcaddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/releases) is in your `PATH`

You do **not** need to download the Caddy source code (it will do that for you).

Then building Caddy (with version information) is as easy as:

<pre><code class="cmd bash">xcaddy build</code></pre>

To build with plugins, use `--with`:

<pre><code class="cmd bash">xcaddy build \
    --with github.com/caddyserver/nginx-adapter
	--with github.com/caddyserver/ntlm-transport@v0.1.1</code></pre>

As you can see, you can customize the versions of plugins with `@` syntax. Versions can be a tag name, commit SHA, or branch.

Cross-platform compilation with `xcaddy` works the same as with the `go` command. For example, to cross-compile for macOS:

<pre><code class="cmd bash">GOOS=darwin xcaddy build</code></pre>



## Docker

You can use the `:builder` image as a short-cut to building a new Caddy binary with custom modules:

```Dockerfile
FROM caddy:<version>-builder AS builder

RUN xcaddy build \
    --with github.com/caddyserver/nginx-adapter \
    --with github.com/hairyhenderson/caddy-teapot-module@v0.0.3-0

FROM caddy:<version>

COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
```

Make sure to replace `<version>` with the latest version of Caddy to start.

Note the second `FROM` instruction â€” this produces a much smaller image by simply overlaying the newly-built binary on top of the regular `caddy` image.

The builder uses `xcaddy` to build Caddy with the provided modules, similar to the process [outlined above](#xcaddy).

To use Docker Compose, see our recommended [`compose.yml`](/docs/running#docker-compose) and usage instructions.



## Package support files for custom builds for Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian

This procedure aims to simplify running custom `caddy` binaries while keeping support files from the `caddy` package.

This procedure allows users to take advantage of the default configuration, systemd service files and bash-completion from the official package.

Requirements:
- Install the `caddy` package according to [these instructions](/docs/install#debian-ubuntu-raspbian)
- Build your custom `caddy` binary (see above sections), or [download](/download) a custom build
- Your custom `caddy` binary should be located in the current directory

Procedure:
<pre><code class="cmd"><span class="bash">sudo dpkg-divert --divert /usr/bin/caddy.default --rename /usr/bin/caddy</span>
<span class="bash">sudo mv ./caddy /usr/bin/caddy.custom</span>
<span class="bash">sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/caddy caddy /usr/bin/caddy.default 10</span>
<span class="bash">sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/caddy caddy /usr/bin/caddy.custom 50</span>
<span class="bash">sudo systemctl restart caddy</span>
</code></pre>

Explanation:

- `dpkg-divert` will move `/usr/bin/caddy` binary to `/usr/bin/caddy.default` and put a diversion in place in case any package want to install a file to this location.

- `update-alternatives` will create a symlink from the desired caddy binary to `/usr/bin/caddy`

- `systemctl restart caddy` will shut down the default version of the Caddy server and start the custom one.

You can change between the custom and default `caddy` binaries by executing the below, and following the on screen information. Then, restart the Caddy service.

<pre><code class="cmd bash">update-alternatives --config caddy</code></pre>

To upgrade Caddy after this point, you may run [`caddy upgrade`](/docs/command-line#caddy-upgrade). This attempts to [download](/download) a build with the same plugins as your current build, with the latest version of Caddy, then replace the current binary with the new one.
