				As I feel our contributors and sponsors do not get enough recognition or appreciation, allow me to interrupt this release announcement with a personal, open letter to the above named...
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're reading this: <i>thank you</i>. You were the primary collaborators on Caddy 2, and this would not have been possible without you. You gave Caddy new <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/dist">distribution packages</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy">containers</a>, docs, features, field testing; and <a href="https://caddy.community/u?period=all">helped countless users</a>. I think almost no topic in our <a href="https://caddy.community">community forums</a> has gone unanswered. That's truly amazing!
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks for sticking with the project and believing in it enough to yield a second version. We've solved some hard problems together&mdash;usually during nights and weekends&mdash;and in days of isolation during this pandemic, no less.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now look at what we have made! Caddy is the only server that grants privacy to its sites' visitors <i>by default</i>. We've raised the bar for the rest of the Web. I hope you are as pleased with our results as I am. Millions more people will soon benefit from your contributions.

							<li><b>Consistent:</b> No invalid configurations can be loaded; your server will never break if a problem is detected at config load.</li>
							<li><b>Isolated:</b> No config changes rely on another. (It helps that HTTP is a stateless protocol!)</li>
							<li><b>Durable:</b> Caddy automatically persists the current, valid configuration to disk and can safely resume it after a power cycle if the <code>--resume</code> flag is used.</li>

				<h2>We fixed all known limitations of v1</h2>
				<p>
					With an <a href="/docs/architecture">all-new architecture</a>, the development of Caddy 2 closed <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+v2">about 400 issues</a> and solved all known limitations on Caddy 1 caused by fundamental design constraints.
				</p>
				<p>
					Caddy 2 is designed to be highly flexible when needed, but also highly focused on its core competency. If there was anything in Caddy 1 that felt out of place or hacky, it won't in v2.
				</p>
				<p>
					This design was an incredible undertaking: of the approximate 14 months spent developing Caddy 2, only about 7 of them actually consisted of writing code; the other half was solely focused on the design of the underlying architecture.

				<h2>Keeps your sites online when other servers... don't</h2>
				<p>
					Caddy has the most robust TLS stack on the market. With <b>stronger memory safety guarantees</b> than OpenSSL (Apache & NGINX) and <b>more advanced certificate automation logic</b> than any other server or utility, Caddy <b>keeps your sites online</b> through problems that other servers don't handle.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<div class="asides top">
					<div>
						<h3>Advanced TLS automation</h3>
						<p>
							Caddy was the first server to fully automate public certificate management&mdash;so we've been doing this longer than anyone. With more than 5 million certificates under management, Caddy has set the gold standard for other servers to live up to:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Async management.</b> Certificate automation never blocks the main thread of the web server.</li>
							<li><b>Gentle retries.</b> Failed validation attempts are retried with exponential backoff for up to 1 month. They don't count against normal rate limits; Caddy uses staging/test endpoints during retries.</li>
							<li><b>OCSP stapling and caching.</b> Caddy staples OCSP to all qualifying certificates and keeps them conservatively fresh. It even caches them to disk in case of extended OCSP responder outages.</li>
							<li><b>Auto-replace after revocation.</b> If the latest OCSP staple indicates a revocation, Caddy automatically replaces the revoked certificate with a new one.</li>
							<li><b>Storage pre-checks.</b> Before attempting costly or valuable ACME transactions, Caddy checks to ensure its storage space is sufficient and writeable.</li>
							<li><b>Internal throttling and job scheduling.</b> Give Caddy a million certs to manage: no problem, it will gracefully manage them as fast as it can without hammering the CA or duplicating jobs over a long period of time.</li>
							<li><b>TLS session ticket key rotation.</b> Caddy automatically rotates TLS 1.2 session ticket keys for better privacy. It can even do this across a cluster!</li>
							<li><b>Fleet coordination.</b> All Caddy instances configured for the same storage backend will automatically share certificate and coordinate management in its cluster.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Real-life examples</h3>
						<p>
							In 2018, several popular sites went down for many users of mainstream clients because crucial OCSP infrastructure had an extended outage. Only Caddy staples and caches OCSP responses by default, so all Caddy sites were unaffected.
						</p>
						<p>
							More recently in 2020, a mass certificate revocation event left many sysadmins scrambling to renew their certificates ahead of schedule. Caddy automatically renews certificates that get revoked, and all Caddy sites were unaffected.
						</p>
						<p>
							Companies have deployed Caddy in front of their site just hours before important audits&mdash;potentially saving their compliance status&mdash;because of Caddy's safe defaults and "batteries included" approach.
						</p>
						<!-- <p>
							Severa customers have been able to replace piles of scripts, external dependencies, and convoluted deployment workflows with Caddy, which manages complex parts of their infrastructure for them.
						</p> -->

				<h2>There's more around the corner</h2>
				<p>
					We already have a number of features to land in the <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/milestone/36">upcoming 2.1 release</a>:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Client certificate auto-renew.</b> Caddy will be able to <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/3198">automatically renew its client certificates</a> used in mTLS, just like it auto-renews its server certificates. You can customize which CA is used for both!
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/3198">Embedded ACME server.</a></b> No need for extra tooling to achieve fully-automated, trusted mTLS within your network! Caddy has partnered with <a href="https://smallstep.com/certificates/">Smallstep</a> to use their open source libraries to bring you internal/mutual TLS that just works.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Numerous Caddyfile improvements.</b> For example: <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/3242">enclosing tokens in backticks</a> <code>`</code> makes it easier to express literal JSON; <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/3255">special subdirectives for customizing <code>php_fastcgi</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/3263">syntax improvements for named matchers</a>, and more advanced routing and error handling capabilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>HTTP/2 over cleartext (H2C).</b> For both <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3218">upstreams</a> and <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3227">downstreams</a>, Caddy 2.1 will be able to serve and proxy plaintext HTTP/2 if required.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>And much more.</b> There are dozens of open issues, most of which are feature requests! We have our work cut out for us. Won't you <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues">get involved</a>?
