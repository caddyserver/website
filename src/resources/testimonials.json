Adoption of memory-safe programming languages is something that both ISRG and the broader computer security community have been encouraging more and more lately.",

		"quote": "About 3-4 TB of traffic reaches our origin servers every day. NGINX did a great job, but we were never 100% happy with the config format; it mostly \"kind of\" worked. When we tried Caddy, we realized in a moment that we need to eliminate NGINX. We felt insecure by such a small config, 1/10th the size of our NGINX config. After deploying a single instance, it outperformed all other NGINX instances (4-10). Now we go all-in on Caddy: A legible config that more than 1 person understands; custom domain rollout is 100% automated; NO ONE (squid, nginx, varnish) can do what the replace-response plugin does -- truly a holy grail; we run our own plugins as well; and we spend 70% LESS on our CPU and memory resources. We are super happy with the product, with the mindset behind it, and the idea to make the web \"easy again\" on your own infrastructure."

We briefly tried writing an Nginx module, but C++ makes me want to tear my hair out. ... I found Caddy the easiest to work with. As an added bonus, the Caddy http middleware module is very close to Go's ServeHTTP interface, and as a result, is very easy to build around and test. ... I believe Caddy and it's extensibility are a great fit if you are trying to build a smart proxy or API gateway. ...

You can literally leave Caddy running for years and just update it with package manager and not worry about TLS certs anymore. That stability is not guaranteed with certbot, it's just yet another daemon service you need to take care of and it broke for me multiple times. Much love to mholt and his team.",
