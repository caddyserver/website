Adoption of memory-safe programming languages is something that both ISRG and the broader computer security community have been encouraging more and more lately.",

It has a neat little feature called On-Demand TLS, which generates SSL certs on the fly. It also lets you specify a callback URL to verify the domain name. ... I got a solid setup up by 7 in the morning, and it worked like a charm. After a quick powernap, I pushed the fix to production, and we finally had a working product 24 hours after launch. ...

Nginx was really problematic, as there was no way to figure out if Nginx had picked up a new ingress or not. It often took 2-5 seconds after our code picked up a new ingress for Nginx to be ready to serve it, meaning that we had to add a lot of time.Sleep() type code, which no one ever wants to read. We briefly tried writing an Nginx module, but C++ makes me want to tear my hair out. ... I found Caddy the easiest to work with. As an added bonus, the Caddy http middleware module is very close to Go's ServeHTTP interface, and as a result, is very easy to build around and test. ... I believe Caddy and it's extensibility are a great fit if you are trying to build a smart proxy or API gateway. ... Caddy's author Matt Holt wrote that Caddy is not just a proxy, it's a powerful, extensible platform for HTTP apps. I couldn't agree more.",
